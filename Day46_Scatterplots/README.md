#  Day 46: Scatterplots in Seaborn

##  Topics Covered
- Creating scatterplots using `sns.scatterplot()`.
- Using `hue` to separate points by categorical variable.
- Adding a third dimension with `size`.
- Changing marker shapes with `style`.
- Combining hue, size, and style for rich visualizations.

##  Key Insights
- Scatterplots are best for visualizing relationships between **two continuous variables**.
- The `hue` parameter helps in identifying groups within data.
- `size` and `style` allow adding more variables into a single 2D plot.
