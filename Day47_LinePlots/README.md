#  Day 47: Line Plots in Seaborn

##  Topics Covered
- Creating line plots with `sns.lineplot()`.
- Adding categorical dimensions using `hue` and `style`.
- Using `size` to represent additional variables.
- Comparing line plots with scatterplots for continuous trends.
- Visualizing multi-dimensional data effectively.

##  Key Insights
- Line plots are ideal for **continuous data** such as time series or trends.
- `hue` allows separation by categories like event or region.
- `style` changes line dashes for better clarity.
- `size` can encode another dimension, e.g., subject differences.
