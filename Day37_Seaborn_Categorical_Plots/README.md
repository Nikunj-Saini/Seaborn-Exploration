# Day 37 - Seaborn Categorical Plots

Today I explored categorical plots in Seaborn, useful for comparing and analyzing categorical variables.

### Concepts Covered:
- **Barplot**: Shows mean values for categories.
- **Countplot**: Displays frequency of categories.
- **Boxplot**: Shows distribution with median, quartiles, and outliers.
- **Violinplot**: Combines boxplot with KDE for distribution shape.

### Key Learnings:
- Barplots are great for comparing averages across groups.
- Countplots quickly show category frequencies.
- Boxplots help detect outliers and spread.
- Violinplots provide detailed view of distribution patterns.
