# Seaborn Data Visualization Journey ðŸŽ¨ðŸ“Š

This repository documents my step-by-step learning of **Seaborn**, a Python library built on Matplotlib that simplifies and enhances data visualization.  
It contains daily notebooks, examples, mini-projects, and insights gained during the journey.

##  Whatâ€™s Inside
- Day-wise Jupyter Notebooks (`DayXX_Topic.ipynb`)
- Exported HTML versions of each notebook
- Mini projects for real-world visualization practice
- README for each day summarizing key learnings

##  Learning Goals
- Understand Seabornâ€™s high-level API for statistical plots.
- Learn how to visualize categorical & numerical data effectively.
- Compare Seaborn vs Matplotlib approaches.
- Build real-world dashboards and projects with Seaborn.

##  Topics Covered (Planned)
1. Introduction & Setup
2. Distribution Plots
3. Categorical Plots
4. Relational Plots
5. Matrix Plots (Heatmaps, Cluster maps)
6. Styling & Customization
7. Mini Projects

##  End Goal
To be confident in using Seaborn for **data storytelling**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **real-world visualization projects**.
