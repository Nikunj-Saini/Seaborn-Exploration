#  Day 45: Histograms & KDE Plots in Seaborn

##  Topics Covered
- Creating simple histograms using `sns.histplot()`.
- Adding KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) for smooth distribution curves.
- Adjusting bins, colors, and plot aesthetics.
- Comparing distributions across categories using `hue`.
- Overlay vs Stacked Histograms for better comparison.

##  Key Insights
- Histograms help visualize data distribution (frequency counts).
- KDE adds a smoothed curve to better understand probability density.
- With `hue`, we can compare distributions between groups like gender or smoker status.
