Today I learned how to customize the look and feel of plots in Seaborn by using different styles and color palettes. Visual appeal plays a big role in making charts readable and impactful.

### Concepts Covered:
- Using `sns.set_style()` to switch between themes like `whitegrid`, `darkgrid`, `white`, `dark`, and `ticks`.
- Applying `sns.set_palette()` to change the default color palette for all plots.
- Exploring built-in palettes such as `deep`, `pastel`, `muted`, `bright`, `dark`, and `colorblind`.
- Using `sns.color_palette()` for custom palettes and specifying color ranges.
- Understanding how consistent styles and palettes improve storytelling in data visualization.

### Key Learnings:
- Style settings affect background grids, ticks, and axis details.
- Palettes ensure visual distinction between categories.
- Choosing the right color palette enhances clarity and reduces confusion.
