# Day 44 – Swarm Plots in Seaborn

##  What I Learned
- Swarm plots display all data points while avoiding overlaps.
- Compared to strip plots, they make distributions clearer.
- Learned to use `hue` for subgrouping and `dodge` for separation.
- Practiced customizing plots with `palette` and `alpha`.

##  Key Functions
- `sns.swarmplot()` → categorical scatterplot with non-overlapping points.
- `hue` → differentiates groups by color.
- `dodge=True` → separates hue groups.
- `alpha` → controls transparency of points.

##  Visuals Created
1. Basic swarm plot.
2. Swarm plot with `hue`.
3. Customized swarm plot with `dodge`, `palette`, and `alpha`.
