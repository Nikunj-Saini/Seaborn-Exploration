# Day 40: Seaborn Categorical Plots (Part 2)

Today I explored four more categorical plots in Seaborn: **boxplot, violinplot, stripplot, and swarmplot**.  

##  Concepts Covered
- `boxplot`: Shows spread, quartiles, and outliers.  
- `violinplot`: Combines boxplot with KDE to show distribution shape.  
- `stripplot`: Plots individual data points (with jitter).  
- `swarmplot`: Improves stripplot by avoiding overlap.  
- Overlay technique: Violin + Stripplot for detailed analysis.  

##  Code Highlights
- Distribution of total bill by day using boxplot & violinplot.  
- Stripplot and swarmplot for visualizing individual data points.  
- Combined violin + stripplot for richer insights.  

##  Practice Task
1. Boxplot of tip by day with hue (gender).  
2. Violinplot of total_bill by smoker status.  
3. Violin + Stripplot for tip distribution by time.
