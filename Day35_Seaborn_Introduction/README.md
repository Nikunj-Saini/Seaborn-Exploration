# Day 35 - Seaborn Introduction

##  What I Learned
- Installed and set up Seaborn.
- Difference between Matplotlib & Seaborn.
- Used built-in datasets (`tips`, `flights`).
- Created first plots: Scatter, Bar, Line.

##  Plots Created
1. Scatterplot of total_bill vs tip.
2. Barplot showing total bill per day.
3. Lineplot for yearly flight passengers.

##  Takeaway
Seaborn makes statistical visualization simple and beautiful compared to Matplotlib.
