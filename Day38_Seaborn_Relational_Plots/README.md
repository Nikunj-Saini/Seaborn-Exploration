# Day 38: Seaborn Relational Plots  

Today, I explored **relational plots** in Seaborn, mainly focusing on `scatterplot` and `lineplot`. These plots are powerful for analyzing relationships between numerical variables and adding categorical dimensions with color, style, and size.  

##  Concepts Covered
- Introduction to **scatterplot** and **lineplot**  
- Adding **hue, style, size** to show multiple dimensions in one plot  
- Using categorical encoding to highlight differences  
- Understanding when to use scatterplots vs lineplots  

##  Code Highlights
- Visualized **total_bill vs tip** in the tips dataset with hue, style, and size.  
- Created **lineplot of tip by table size**, separated by smoker status and gender.  
- Practiced with the **iris dataset** to visualize species differences in scatter and line plots.  

##  Practice Task
1. Create a scatterplot of `sepal_length` vs. `sepal_width` (iris dataset), color and style by species.  
2. Build a lineplot of `sepal_length` vs. `petal_length` (iris dataset), grouped by species.
