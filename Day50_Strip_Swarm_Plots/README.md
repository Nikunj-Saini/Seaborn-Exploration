#  Day 50: Strip Plot & Swarm Plot in Seaborn

##  Topics Covered
- `sns.stripplot()` → Displays individual data points with optional jitter.
- `sns.swarmplot()` → Similar but avoids overlapping points automatically.
- Parameters:
  - `jitter` → Adds random noise to avoid overlap in stripplot.
  - `hue` → Colors by category.
  - `dodge=True` → Separates hue groups side by side.

##  Key Insights
- Strip plots are simple but can cause **point overlap**.  
- Swarm plots solve overlap by adjusting positions.  
- Great for **showing all data points** instead of summaries (like boxplots).  
- Useful for analyzing **distributions within categories**.
