# Day 43 – Strip Plots in Seaborn

## What I Learned
- Strip plots show **all individual data points** for categorical variables.  
- The `jitter` parameter spreads points to reduce overlap.  
- Adding `hue` allows comparison between categories within each group.  
- `dodge=True` separates hue groups side by side for clarity.  
- Strip plots can be combined with **boxplots or violin plots** to show both summary statistics and raw data.  
- Orientation can be switched to horizontal for readability.  

## Why It’s Useful
Strip plots are useful for **visualizing raw distributions** and spotting outliers. They complement boxplots/violins by showing **every single data point** instead of just summary stats.
