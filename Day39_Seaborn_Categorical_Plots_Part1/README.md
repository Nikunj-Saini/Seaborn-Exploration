# Day 39: Seaborn Categorical Plots (Part 1)

Today, I started exploring categorical plots in Seaborn, focusing on **barplot** and **countplot**.  

##  Concepts Covered
- `barplot` for showing average values of a numerical variable grouped by a category  
- `countplot` for showing frequency counts of categorical values  
- Using **hue** to add a second categorical dimension  
- Practical examples with the `tips` dataset  

##  Code Highlights
- Average total bill per day (barplot)  
- Count of observations per day (countplot)  
- Comparison of gender differences in spending and counts with `hue`  

##  Practice Task
1. Average tip amount per day (barplot).  
2. Countplot for smokers vs non-smokers.  
3. Grouped barplot of average total_bill by day and smoker status.
