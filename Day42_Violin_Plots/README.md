# Day 42 – Violin Plots in Seaborn 

## What I Learned
- Violin plots show both **distribution (via KDE)** and **summary stats (like a boxplot)**.  
- Basic violin plots help visualize the density of values for different categories.  
- Adding `hue` allows grouped violin plots.  
- The `split=True` option compares two subcategories inside the same violin.  
- Inner markings like `"quartile"` or `"box"` give more statistical detail.  
- Violin plots can be combined with swarmplots for detailed point-level insights.  

## Why It’s Useful
Boxplots summarize data but hide distribution shapes. Violin plots reveal skewness, multimodal patterns, and spread, making them very powerful in exploratory data analysis.
